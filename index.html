        <p class="lead mb-4">I am from the city of Richmond, California; however, I am currently living in Riverside, California as I am attending the University of California, Riverside (also known as UCR) to obtain my Bachelor’s Degree in Business Management. I am expected to graduate in June 2025, but since I am so eager to complete my requirements I have been taking the maximum units that students can take as well as taking courses in the summer to remain on top of my priorities.<br><br>

        I come from an immediate family of eight members. I am the eldest of a total of seven siblings (four by my mother and three by my father). It is extremely important for me to set an example for all of my siblings as I am the person they look up to for guidance as well as advice.<br><br>

        I am a christian woman and have attended church almost all of my life. In addition, I have been a praise dancer for approximately fourteen years and counting. Praise dancing is something beyond fun. It’s my way of connecting to God.<br><br>
        I graduated from Jesse Bethel High School Summa Cum Laude with a 4.0 GPA. At Bethel, students were required to choose an academy of their choice and I chose Business. Therefore, I am quite knowledgeable in the field of business in regards to certain aspects. Additionally, I am currently enrolled in business courses now, which is providing me with more knowledge in the business world. For example, I am currently taking a computing course, which has given me the opportunity to learn how to work certain programs/applications on any type of computer. This has benefited me in ways where I now know how to manage certain softwares such as Word, Excel, Access, and PowerPoint (including creating HTML websites).<br><br>
        Growing up I have dreamed of becoming a Fashion Designer and Wardrobe Stylist as I have an eye for creativity that differs from the typical designs sold in stores. In other words, I have extremely good taste, and I know exactly what’s fashionable and what’s not as I keep up with the daily styles that are trending. Typically, I can identify trendy styles as the source of Instagram allows people to showcase all of their fashionable outfits by picture/video. Moreover, I have an imaginative mind, which allows me to come up with new innovations and match various colors, designs, textures, and patterns to make the absolute best designs with great detail.<br><br>
        Therefore, I am a wide-variety of things. Ambitious. Brave. Capable. Committed. Consistent. Competent. Creative. Determined. Ethical. Encouraging. Fashionable. Friendly. Gentle. Helpful. Level Headed. Outgoing. Positive. Professional. Resilient. Scholarly. Skilled. Sociable. Smart. Stylish. Talented. Trusting. Well-rounded. Well Educated. I can go on and on…
